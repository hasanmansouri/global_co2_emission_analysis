# Global CO2 Emission Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing global CO2 emissions trends from 1960 to 2019 and identifying key patterns in the data. My goal is to understand how emissions have changed in different countries and explore the factors that have influenced these changes. I want to use this analysis to better understand the role of countries in climate change and look for ways we can work towards a more sustainable future.

## Project Files:
- **Global_emissions_final.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook where all the analysis is done. It includes data processing, visualizations, and insights about global emissions trends.
- **co2_emissions_kt_by_country.csv**: A dataset containing CO2 emissions (in kilotons) for different countries across several years.

## What This Project Shows:
- The rise and fall of CO2 emissions over the years in multiple countries.
- Key moments where emissions sharply increased or decreased (such as economic events, policy changes, etc.).
- Visualizations to help understand the patterns in global CO2 emissions.

## My Goals:
- To gain a deeper understanding of the environmental impact of different countries.
- To analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and other factors like economic changes, political decisions, and global events (like the Soviet collapse).
- To highlight the importance of taking action for sustainability and reducing emissions to fight climate change.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasanmansouri/global_co2_emission_analysis.git
